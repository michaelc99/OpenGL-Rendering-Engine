Basic 3d rendering engine using OpenGL.
GLFW is used for context creation and window handling.
GLAD is used for loading opengl extensions and functions.


Currently a functioning version of the basic engine with no animation or physically based rendering is on branch "basic_model_loading".
- Press "w" and "s" to move forward or backwards (the model in the example starts behind the camera).
- Model of wolf and textures not created by me. Credit/source: http://wp.me/P3dmoi-1uc
